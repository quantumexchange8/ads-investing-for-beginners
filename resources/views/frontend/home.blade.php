                          <h3>Hands-off investments managed by a human</h3>
                          <p>
                            If you’d prefer to park your investments with a professional, a financial advisor may be the way to go. Investment management services — 
                            sometimes called wealth advisory services — are offered by all of the major financial institutions in Canada.
                          </p>
                          <p>With this strategy, a financial advisor builds and manages your investments on your behalf.
                            This strategy is best for investors who don’t want to manage their own investments and prefer the human touch of a financial advisor.
                          </p>
                          
                         </div>

                          <h3>Hands-off investments managed by an algorithm</h3>
                          <p> Some brokerages offer access to an automated investment service called a robo-advisor. Despite the name, this service 
                            isn’t administered by a robot, but it is made possible by sophisticated investment algorithms.
                        </p>
                        <p> Here’s how it works:
                        <ul>
                              <li> First, you fill out an online application to open an account.</li>
                              <li> Next, you answer a series of questions about your financial goals and how much risk you’re willing to take with your investments.</li>
                              <li> Then, the robo-advisor puts together a portfolio on your behalf based on your questionnaire responses.</li>
                              <li> The robo-advisor uses complex algorithms to monitor your account, moving investments in and out of your portfolio according to your 
                                   financial goals. This technique is called portfolio rebalancing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p> This strategy is best for investors who don’t want to manage their own investments and feel comfortable entrusting their money to a digital service.</p>  </div>
                      
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-contact" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-contact-tab">
                          <h3>Pick your own investments</h3>
                          <p> For those that want full control over the investing process, self-directed investing, or DIY investing, may be the best way to go. 
                              This approach involves opening an account with an investment brokerage and putting together a portfolio of your choosing. 
                              You’ll also be solely responsible for monitoring your investments and making adjustments over time as needed.
                          </p>
                          <p>This strategy is best for investors who want to manage their investments firsthand and don’t mind the extra homework 
                             that often comes with managing a portfolio solo.

                              <p>Stocks or equities are shares of a company that you ideally buy low and sell higher. They also may generate income through dividends, or regular payouts of profits 
                                that some companies pay to shareholders. For example, when Facebook first went public in May 2012, you could buy shares for about $38 each. The company’s stock has skyrocketed since then, 
                                making it one of the most successful investments of this millennium.</p>

                              <p>Remember: Not all companies offer dividends and stock values don't always go up. If share prices fall, you may wind up with stocks worth less than you paid for them.</p>

                              <h1>Bonds</h1>
                              <p> A bond is essentially a loan from an investor to a borrower. Borrowers may be anyone from federal and local governments 
                                 to private companies. Investors generally expect to receive full repayment of the loan—plus interest—by the time the loan is due.
                              </p>
                              <p> Bonds are typically a less risky investment than stocks but often have lower returns. Both factors depend in part on the borrower’s 
                                  creditworthiness.Some high-yield bonds can even have stock-like risk of loss. There are also bonds with lower interest rates that can offer 
                                  tax advantages,such as municipal bonds or Treasury bonds.

                            <p> You can take your money and put it into a second home or an investment property. Both types of investments can be 
                              rented out to recoup some or all of the money you’re spending on the property for the year. Renting out multiple properties 
                              can help you achieve a compounding impact on your overall monthly income.
                            </p>
                            <p> While you can receive income from renting out multiple properties, the easiest investment in real estate for beginners 
                              is through holding the property and selling it for more than you bought it for down the road. If you choose the area of 
                              the property well then holding it as an asset for multiple years can mean a nice increase when you sell it one day.

        <h2>Investment Planning</h2>
        <p>Investment planning is the process of identifying financial goals and converting them through building a plan. 
           Investment planning is the main component of financial planning. The investment planning begins
           with identification of goals and objectives. Then we need to match those goals with our available financial resources.

            <h4><a href="">Find when and how much you are saving</a></h4>
            <p>This is the first step of investment planning. As soon as we are employed we should start saving. Whatever our salary is 
               we should not spend all of it and start saving for our retirement and unforeseen emergencies.

            <p>We need to identify our short term as well as long term goals. This is how we start goal setting in investment planning. 
               Our goals can be saving for a vacation or buying some gadget which we really want to own. This can be termed as short term goal as 
               saving required for this is less than twelve months.
